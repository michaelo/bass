Bass contributing guide
===

I appreciate the intereset in Bass and your curiosity into how to contribute to the project.

Bear in mind that this project shall not grow indefinetily - it shall solve a set of defined problems, within a given scope of operational leeway.

The prime areas where contributions are desired are:

* Functional errors in docs and code
* Implementation and robustifications of integration and processing of incoming webhooks from common source control systems
* Simplification of implementation
* Automated integration and end-to-end tests

On the other hand, arbitrary "nice to have" features, architectural changes, paradigmic rewrites etc will most likely not be accepted.

Getting started
